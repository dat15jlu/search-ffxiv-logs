# Search FFXIV Logs

This is a very simple program that tries to more effectively search a directory of log files, generated by the FFXIV game client.

## How to use

### Running with Python
1. Put your log folder in the same directory as the python script.
2. Run in a terminal window by entering
```bash
$ python search_ffxiv_logs.py log_file search_term
```
where `log_file` is the name of the log directory, and `search_term` is the string you are searching for.

### Running with executable
1. Navigate to the directory which has the executable (`.exe`) file.
1. Shift + right click on any empty space in this directory in Windows File Explorer, then select **Open PowerShell window here**.

2. Once in PowerShell, you can run the `.exe` like this:
```bash
.\search_ffxiv_logs.exe log_file "thing to search for"
```
where log_file is the name of your log file and "thing to search for" is what text you want to look for. So for example, you could write
```bash
.\search_ffxiv_logs.exe log "Annie Keito" > output.txt
```
to search all files in the "log" directory for occurrences of "Annie Keito". The last part (`> output.txt`) just means save the results in a file called output.txt, otherwise it will print everything inside the PowerShell window.
